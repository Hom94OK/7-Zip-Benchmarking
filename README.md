This is the Github Page of some testing utilities for creating benchmarks with some windows programs.

Here a small How To and what you will need:

- a windows system, for creating the benchmarks with [wtime](https://github.com/mcmilk/wtime)
- `RunTests.cmd` is an example on how I benchmark [7-Zip ZS](https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/)
- some linux box, for running `Logfile2csv.sh`
  - this script will generate `csv` files from the logfiles
  - you can modify both scripts to fit you needs
